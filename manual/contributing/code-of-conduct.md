# NebulaForge Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in NebulaForge a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes
* Focusing on shared community goals rather than individual preferences

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Sexualized language/imagery and unwelcome advances
* Trolling, derogatory comments, and personal/political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in professional settings

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers ("Stewards") are responsible for clarifying and enforcing community standards. They will take appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Stewards have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within NebulaForge project spaces and extends to all public venues where individuals represent the project. This includes:

* Official repositories and documentation
* Project mailing lists and communication channels
* Public events and social media
* Private correspondence between community members regarding project business

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Stewards at conduct@nebulaforge.org. All complaints will be reviewed promptly and investigated fairly.

Maintainers will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Violations may result in consequences deemed appropriate, including:

1. **Warning**: A private, written warning with clarity about the violation
2. **Censorship**: Removal of comments, commits, code, wiki edits, or issues
3. **Probation**: Temporary restrictions on contributor privileges
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent prohibition from all project spaces

Stewards must respect confidentiality when addressing reported incidents.
